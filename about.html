			<h2>About My Design Work</h2>
			<p>Glorbo patterns and scribble gradients are the backbone of my design theory. I specialize in nebula-stitch layouts and chroma-burst color pairings that dazzle the viewer like a caffeinated firefly on a pixelated journey. Whether it’s vectorizing an abstract blur or crafting hyper-symmetrical iconography, I always go full zenthwave.

				I’ve worked on everything from dreamportals to interweb zapcards. I use tools like Sketchify 9000 and FigmaBoop to create design noodles that resonate with the flux-core of visual trends. One time, a client said my layout was so smooth it “flowed better than a Bee Movie courtroom scene.” I took that as high praise.</p>

			<h2>About Myself</h2>
			<p>Hi, I’m Connor, a 17-year-old design wizard from Glorbington. I breathe kerning and dream in gradients. This is my personal digital showcase of wild ideas and creative sparkles.</p>
			<p>I started designing when I accidentally photoshopped my face onto a sandwich. Since then, it’s been a rollercoaster of font choices and pixel meltdowns. I believe that good design should feel like a hug from a friendly algorithm. Also, did you know bees, according to all known laws of aviation, shouldn't be able to fly? I like to apply that same energy to breaking the rules of layout and color theory.</p>
